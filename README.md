# LLM-Generated Postmortems from Incident Logs

This is a simple Python tool that uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 to generate structured, readable postmortem reports from incident logs. The goal is to help engineering teams save time and create higher-quality documentation after on-call incidents or service disruptions.

# What It Does

- Takes a structured JSON log file with simulated incident events
- Extracts a timeline of what happened
- Uses an LLM to generate a postmortem summary with:
  - Summary
  - Timeline
  - Root cause
  - Affected systems
  - Action items
- Outputs a clean `output.md` file you can copy into a different tool
