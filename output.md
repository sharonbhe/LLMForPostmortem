**Postmortem Report**

**Incident Summary:**

On [Date], a production incident occurred affecting the cart-service, resulting in increased latency and 502 Bad Gateway errors on the /checkout and add-to-cart endpoints. The incident began shortly after a deployment and was resolved by rolling back the changes. The incident lasted approximately 26 minutes, during which time users experienced checkout failures and payment authorization issues.

**Incident Timeline:**

- **12:00:** Normal traffic observed.
- **12:02:** Login successful, indicating normal user authentication.
- **12:04:** [ALERT] Latency spike detected on /checkout endpoint.
- **12:06:** Deploy #287 triggered for cart-service.
- **12:08:** 502 Bad Gateway errors observed, indicating service disruption.
- **12:10:** Error rate exceeded the threshold for cart-service.
- **12:12:** Spike in checkout failures reported.
- **12:14:** Payment authorization failed, impacting transaction completion.
- **12:16:** Token renewal attempted, suggesting possible authentication issues.
- **12:18:** Repeated 502 errors on add-to-cart endpoint.
- **12:20:** Rollback initiated for cart-service to revert recent changes.
- **12:22:** Errors cleared after rollback, indicating service recovery.
- **12:24:** Checkout response times returned to normal levels.
- **12:26:** Alerts cleared for cart-service, confirming issue resolution.
- **12:28:** Inventory sync confirmed, ensuring data consistency.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the incident was identified as a faulty deployment (Deploy #287) for the cart-service. The deployment introduced changes that led to increased latency and 502 errors on critical endpoints. The exact nature of the faulty changes needs further investigation, but it is suspected to involve misconfigurations or code errors affecting service communication and token handling.

**Affected Systems:**

- **Cart-service:** Primary service affected, responsible for handling cart operations.
- **Checkout Endpoint:** Experienced latency spikes and failures.
- **Add-to-cart Endpoint:** Repeated 502 errors observed.
- **Payment Authorization:** Failures impacted transaction processing.

**Action Items:**

1. **Conduct a Detailed Code Review:**
   - Review the changes introduced in Deploy #287 to identify specific issues.
   - Implement additional testing and validation steps for future deployments.

2. **Improve Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Enhance monitoring for cart-service to detect similar issues earlier.
   - Set up more granular alerts for latency and error rates.

3. **Implement Deployment Safeguards:**
   - Introduce canary deployments to test changes on a smaller scale before full rollout.
   - Establish a rollback plan for all critical service deployments.

4. **Enhance Incident Response Procedures:**
   - Review and update incident response playbooks to ensure quick identification and resolution of similar issues.
   - Conduct a training session for the team on handling service disruptions.

5. **Investigate Token Handling:**
   - Analyze token renewal processes to ensure reliability and robustness.
   - Consider implementing additional logging for token-related operations.

By addressing these action items, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and improve the overall reliability and resilience of our services.
